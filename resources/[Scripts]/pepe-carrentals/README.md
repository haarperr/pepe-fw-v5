## FEATURES 
[Lots of stuff! So please watch the Video!](https://youtu.be/pki6ms0_Ods)

## SETUP
- **Run the SQL file included with the REPOSITORY**
- I would just suggest checking the `CONFIG.LUA` for once to ensure that everything is as per your needs. 
- Change fxversion in fxmanifest as required. 

## WORD FROM THE DEV
One of the Best Releases I have done so far. It took a lot of effort from my side, both in Coding as well as Testing. Literally the Code is self written, and hence not the BEST, I am not that good at optimising, but I have tried my Best. I have added lots of elements in the Preview to make it lot more explainatory, everything took a lot of time and effort, and hence please drop a like, and Join the Discord too! :)
